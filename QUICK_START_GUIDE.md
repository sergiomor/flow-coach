# Quest-Based Experience Design Skill - Quick Start Guide

## What You Have

A comprehensive expert system for designing quest-based experience platforms with 12 complete example quests covering every activity category from your framework.

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Unzip and Explore (5 minutes)
```bash
unzip quest-experience-design-skill.zip
cd quest-experience-design-skill
```

**Start here**: `README.md` - Quick overview  
**Then read**: `examples/INDEX.md` - See all 12 quest examples  
**Deep dive**: `SKILL.md` - Complete theoretical framework  

### 2. Pick Your First Quest to Design (10 minutes)

Choose one activity from your "What do people want to do?" framework:

- **Want food/tourism quests?** → Study Wellington examples
- **Want hackathon/competition?** → Study AI Hacket
- **Want sales/work quests?** → Study Sales Warrior
- **Want personal development?** → Study Quest Maker
- **Want career progression?** → Study SFIA/Micro-credentials
- **Want environmental?** → Study Kaitiaki
- **Want youth programs?** → Study William Pike
- **Want outdoor adventure?** → Study Tongariro/Rotorua

### 3. Use the Template (30-60 minutes)

Open: `templates/quest-design-template.md`

Fill out each section for your chosen activity:
- [ ] Quest metadata (name, type, duration, difficulty)
- [ ] Compelling narrative
- [ ] Dragon identification (what internal obstacle?)
- [ ] 5-7 structured tasks
- [ ] NPC character and dialogue
- [ ] Rewards structure
- [ ] Verification methods

### 4. Test Your Quest Design (Review)

Check your quest against these criteria:
- [ ] Does it have a compelling "why"? (narrative)
- [ ] Is the dragon clearly identified?
- [ ] Are tasks concrete and verifiable?
- [ ] Does the NPC provide meaningful support?
- [ ] Are rewards both tangible and transformative?
- [ ] Is there a clear dragon moment where users face resistance?
- [ ] Does completing this quest actually change the person?

## Key Concepts to Remember

### The Dragon
Every quest has a specific internal obstacle (the "dragon"):
- Procrastination ("I'll do it later")
- Fear of failure ("What if I'm not good enough?")
- Physical fear (heights, water, challenges)
- Social fear (judgment, rejection)
- Doubt about impact ("Does this even matter?")

**Your job**: Identify it explicitly, prepare support for it, celebrate when it's faced.

### The NPC
Not just a chatbot - a character with:
- Name reflecting their role/culture
- Distinct personality and communication style
- Knowledge appropriate to the quest context
- Ability to recognize struggle and provide support
- Celebration of victories, especially dragon-slaying

### Transformation Over Transaction
Bad quest: "Complete 10 tasks, get a badge"  
Good quest: "Embark on journey, face your fear, become someone new, earn recognition"

The badge is evidence of transformation, not the goal itself.

## Technical Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-8)
- [ ] Quest design template and examples
- [ ] Basic NPC chatbot (simple scripted responses)
- [ ] Manual verification (human review)
- [ ] Simple badge generation
- [ ] 1-2 pilot quests with small user group

### Phase 2: Core Platform (Weeks 9-16)
- [ ] Mobile app with location features
- [ ] xAPI Learning Record Store integration
- [ ] Verifiable credentials system (W3C standard)
- [ ] Provider integration API
- [ ] 5-10 quests across 2-3 categories

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 5-12)
- [ ] Advanced NPC with LLM integration
- [ ] Automated verification where possible
- [ ] Multiple city/region launches
- [ ] Corporate and partner integrations
- [ ] 50+ quests across all categories

## Partnership Approach

**Step 1**: Identify potential partners from examples  
**Step 2**: Show them the specific quest example for their domain  
**Step 3**: Explain the value proposition:
- Increased engagement with their offerings
- Better completion rates (quests > goals)
- Rich data on user behavior and preferences
- Modern, mobile-first experience
- Community building and social proof

**Step 4**: Pilot program - small, measurable, time-bound  
**Step 5**: Iterate based on data, scale what works

## Success Metrics to Track

**Per Quest**:
- Completion rate (target: 60-80%)
- Time to completion
- Dragon success rate (people who face and complete dragon moment)
- User satisfaction rating
- Re-engagement (do another quest)

**Platform-Wide**:
- Total quests completed
- Active users (monthly)
- Provider partnerships
- Credentials issued and verified
- User retention (3-month, 12-month)

## Resources in the Skill

- **Main Framework**: SKILL.md (45,000 words)
- **Full Examples**: 8 detailed quests (3,000-4,500 words each)
- **Quick Templates**: 4 abbreviated patterns
- **Design Template**: Comprehensive quest creation guide
- **Reference Diagrams**: Your original architecture images
- **Total**: ~85,000 words of expert knowledge

## Questions? Issues?

Review the relevant section:
- **Conceptual questions**: SKILL.md sections on philosophy and principles
- **Design questions**: examples/ folder for similar quest types
- **Technical questions**: SKILL.md architecture sections
- **Business questions**: Partnership models in each example

## Remember

Start small, test with real users, iterate based on feedback. The best quests emerge from trying, learning, and improving - not from perfect planning.

**Your first quest won't be perfect. That's okay. Ship it, learn from it, make the next one better.**
