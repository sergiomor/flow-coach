## Template Notes

This template is designed to be comprehensive but flexible. Not every section will apply to every quest. Adapt as needed while maintaining the core elements:

1. **Compelling Narrative** - The story that makes tasks meaningful
2. **Clear Dragon** - The internal obstacle and how to support facing it
3. **Structured Tasks** - Specific, verifiable actions that progress the story
4. **Authentic NPC** - A character that guides and supports appropriately
5. **Meaningful Rewards** - Recognition that matters beyond the platform
6. **Transformation Focus** - Real change in capability, confidence, or perspective

Remember: **Quests are adventures, not checklists.** Every design choice should serve the experience, not just the efficiency of completion.
