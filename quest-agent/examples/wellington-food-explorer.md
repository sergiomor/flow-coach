# Example Quest: The Wellington Food Explorer

## Quest Overview

**Type**: Experience-Based (Exploration)  
**Duration**: 2-4 hours  
**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Location**: Wellington, New Zealand  

## Narrative

You've arrived in Wellington, the culinary capital of New Zealand. But you're not just here to eat – you're here to discover the hidden stories behind the city's food culture. As an apprentice Food Explorer, you'll uncover three legendary local establishments, each with a secret that only the locals know.

Your guide, Tui (a local NPC named after the native bird), knows all the best spots and the stories that make them special. Can you complete your food journey and earn the Wellington Food Explorer badge?

## The Dragon

**Internal Obstacle**: Fear of trying new foods or going to unfamiliar places alone

**Dragon Moment**: Task 3 - ordering something you've never tried before in a language/style you're not familiar with (e.g., flat white, hokey pokey ice cream)

**Dragon Support**: Tui will encourage you, provide pronunciation help, and share stories of other explorers who tried new things

## Quest Structure

### Task 1: Find the Harbourside Roastery
**Objective**: Locate Wellington's historic waterfront coffee roastery  
**Challenge**: Use location clues rather than GPS directly  
**Verification**: Take a photo of the roastery sign  
**Dragon**: Small - navigating unfamiliar streets  

**NPC Dialogue** (Tui):
> "Kia ora! Welcome to Wellington. Ready for an adventure? Our first stop is a special place where they've been roasting coffee beans for over 30 years. Head toward the harbour – you'll smell it before you see it! The building has a blue facade and you'll know it by the old coffee roaster visible through the windows."

### Task 2: Learn a Local Coffee Term
**Objective**: Order a coffee and learn what makes a "flat white" different from a latte  
**Challenge**: Ask the barista to explain the difference  
**Verification**: Voice recording or written explanation  
**Dragon**: Small - talking to strangers  

**NPC Dialogue** (Tui):
> "Here's a local secret: the flat white was invented right here in New Zealand! While you're ordering, ask the barista what makes it different from a latte. Wellingtonians are friendly – they love sharing coffee knowledge. You've got this!"

### Task 3: Try Something New (Dragon Moment)
**Objective**: Order and try a local food you've never had before  
**Challenge**: Step outside comfort zone with an unfamiliar food  
**Verification**: Photo of the food + reflection on the experience  
**Dragon**: MAIN - fear of unfamiliar foods  

**NPC Dialogue** (Tui):
> "This is your dragon moment, explorer. I'm going to recommend something that might be completely new to you. Trust me – this is how you become a real food explorer. Here are three options [provides culturally appropriate local foods]. Pick one that challenges you. Remember: the dragon doesn't want to fight; it just wants you to stay in your comfort zone. But you're braver than that."

**Post-Dragon Dialogue**:
> "You did it! You slayed your dragon! How do you feel? Whether you loved it or not, you tried something new. That's what explorers do. This is a moment to remember."

### Task 4: Discover the Story
**Objective**: Find a third location and learn its hidden history  
**Challenge**: Talk to staff or locals to learn the story  
**Verification**: Share the story (text or voice recording)  
**Dragon**: Small - continuing after victory  

**NPC Dialogue** (Tui):
> "You're on a roll now! For your final stop, head to [location]. This place has been a Wellington institution since [year], but there's a secret about how it got its name. Your mission: find out the story. Hint: Ask someone who works there, or check if there's a plaque or sign."

### Task 5: Reflect on Your Journey
**Objective**: Complete quest reflection  
**Challenge**: Articulate what you learned and how you grew  
**Verification**: Short written reflection (5-7 sentences)  
**Dragon**: None - celebrating completion  

**NPC Dialogue** (Tui):
> "Ka pai! Well done, explorer. You've completed your food journey through Wellington. Take a moment to reflect: What surprised you? What was harder than expected? What did you learn about yourself? Your reflection will be part of your badge story."

5. **Local Authenticity**: Tui provides genuine Wellington perspective
6. **Social Safe**: Can be done alone but comfortable for groups too

### Potential Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: User doesn't like trying new foods  
**Solution**: Provide three options with different challenge levels; allow substitution

**Issue**: Location is closed or unavailable  
**Solution**: Have backup locations; NPC can adapt route dynamically

**Issue**: User feels rushed or pressured  
**Solution**: No time limit; can pause and resume; NPC is encouraging not pushy

**Issue**: Language barriers for non-English speakers  
**Solution**: NPC provides translations; visual menus; gesture recommendations

## Iteration Opportunities

After launch, consider:
- Adding weather-adaptive routes (indoor alternatives for rain)
- Creating "social" version with team challenges
- Developing "deep dive" follow-up quest for specific cuisines
- Partnering with restaurants for special quest-only menu items
- Creating seasonal variations (Wellington on a Plate festival tie-in)
